The Katsina Royal Palace known as 'Gidan Korau' is a huge complex located in the centre of the ancient city.[citation needed] It is a symbol of culture, history and traditions of 'Katsinawa'. According to historical account, it was built in 1348 CE by Muhammadu Korau, who is believed to have been the first Muslim King of Katsina. This explains why it is traditionally known as 'Gidan Korau' (House of Korau). It is one of the oldest and among the first generation palaces, along with Daura, Kano and Zazzau. The palace was encircled with a rampart, 'Ganuwar Gidan Sarki' (which is now gone). The main gate which leads to the palace is known as 'Kofar Soro', while the gate at the backyard is called 'Kofar Bai' (now gone).

Surrounded by city wall 21 kilometres (13 mi) in length, Katsina is believed to have been founded circa 1100.

From the 17th to the 18th century, Katsina was the commercial heart of Hausaland and became the largest of the seven Hausa city-states. Katsina was conquered by the Fulani during the Fulani War in 1807. In 1903, the Emir, Abubakar dan Ibrahim, accepted British rule, which continued until Nigerian independence from Britain in 1960.
